This is a DIO and Santander partnership project challenge - Operações Bancárias Simples com Switch

## Description
You are developing a simple Java program to simulate basic banking operations. The application must allow the user to make deposits, withdrawals and check the balance in a virtual bank account.

Prohibited
The program will display a menu with the following options:

1. Deposit
2. To withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Close
The user will choose one of these options by typing the corresponding number.

Exit
Using a switch, the program will perform the operation chosen by the user.

If the user chooses:

1: The program will request the amount to be deposited and update the balance. Additionally, you must print the current balance with the message "Current balance: {balance with 1 decimal place}".
2: The program will request the amount to be withdrawn and check if there is sufficient balance. Therefore, you must print "Current balance: {balance with 1 decimal place}" when the balance is sufficient and "Insufficient balance."
3: The program will only display the current account balance: "Current balance: {balance with 1 decimal place}".
0: The program will close, printing "Program ended.".
